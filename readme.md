> ### Stencil codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

**âš  THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

So far, I've got all the templates and proper auth in place. You can already register, log-in and change your settings.

## What is left:

- Error handling for forms (displaying them for users)
- Testing
- Pagination
- Changing the document's title according to current page
- See these and some other minor changes by searching for comments containing `TODO:`

<!-- ### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Stencil** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
